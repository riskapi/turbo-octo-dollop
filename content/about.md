## About Me

As a cybersecurity risk professional, I have a deep interest in understanding and managing the evolving threats and vulnerabilities in today's digital landscape. Over the years, I’ve focused on identifying and addressing security risks, leveraging my background in **mathematics**, **automation**, **artificial intelligence**, and **data science** to help protect critical systems and information.

I’m particularly fascinated by how technology can be used to enhance security practices. From automating processes to harnessing the power of AI for threat detection, I enjoy finding innovative ways to improve cybersecurity measures and stay ahead of emerging risks.

When I’m not tackling cybersecurity challenges, I love spending time outdoors. **Backpacking** is one of my favorite ways to disconnect and recharge. I’m also a fan of **software-defined radio (SDR)**, where I explore radio communications through software—a hobby that blends my love for technology with personal exploration.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
