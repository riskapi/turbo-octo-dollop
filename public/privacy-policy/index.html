This includes, but is not limited to, interactions through my website, API access, email communications, direct messaging, and any other form of personal or professional interaction. This policy applies to all personal data shared with me, regardless of how it is collected.\nSupport for Encryption and Secure Communication I support and encourage the use of end-to-end encryption technologies for any communications to enhance privacy and data security. End-to-end encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient can read the content of the messages, and no third party (including service providers) has access.\nIf you wish to communicate using encrypted methods, feel free to contact me via services that support end-to-end encryption, such as:\nSignal: A messaging app that provides secure, end-to-end encrypted communications. ProtonMail: For encrypted email communication, you can contact me using ProtonMail or any other email service that supports encryption. PGP/GPG: You may request my PGP/GPG public key to encrypt emails sent to me. Please note that while I take steps to facilitate secure communication, the security of any communication depends on the tools used by both parties. I cannot guarantee complete security if encryption is not used.\nInformation Collection I may collect personal data during any form of interaction, including but not limited to:\nWebsite Visits: When you visit my website, information such as your IP address, browser type, and device information may be collected. API Access: When interacting with any APIs hosted on my domain, personal data such as IP addresses, authentication tokens, and usage logs may be collected to monitor usage and maintain security. Email and Messaging: When you communicate with me via email or messaging platforms (e.g., SMS, social media, or messaging apps), I may collect your contact information, the content of your communications, and any attachments provided. In-Person or Direct Communication: If you interact with me personally (e.g., meetings, phone calls, or events), any personal information shared during these interactions, such as your name, contact details, and the content of our conversations, may be collected. Other Protocols: Any interaction via other technological protocols (such as SSH, FTP, or others) may result in logging of IP addresses, timestamps, and transmitted data. Use of Information The information collected through any interaction with me may be used for the following purposes:\nCommunication: To respond to inquiries, provide support, or engage in discussions based on the nature of our interaction. Security and Monitoring: To ensure the security and integrity of my domain and communications, including monitoring for suspicious activity or unauthorized access. API Usage: To manage, authenticate, and monitor API usage and ensure proper functioning of the provided services. Personal Interaction: To facilitate and maintain professional and personal relationships, ensuring effective communication and cooperation. Website Analytics: To understand how visitors interact with my website and improve its functionality and content, using non-personally identifiable information. Third-Party Service Providers To manage and secure the infrastructure supporting this website and related services, I rely on third-party providers such as Google, Microsoft 365, Cloudflare, and Apple. These companies may process or store your data when you interact with my domain or communicate with me.\nGoogle: I may use Google services such as Gmail for email communications or Google Analytics for understanding website usage. Microsoft 365: Microsoft 365 services may be used for email, document storage, and other professional tools. Cloudflare: Cloudflare is used to enhance the security and performance of this website through features such as DDoS protection, content delivery, and SSL certificates. Apple: If you communicate with me via Apple services (such as iCloud, iMessage, or Apple Mail), your data may be processed by Apple in accordance with their privacy policies. These providers have their own privacy policies, and while I take measures to ensure data is handled securely, these third parties may have access to data as required for the operation of their services. For more information on how these third parties manage data, please refer to their respective privacy policies.\nData Sharing and Disclosure I do not sell or share personal information with third parties for commercial purposes. However, personal data may be disclosed under the following circumstances:\nLegal Obligations: If required by law or in response to lawful requests from law enforcement or government agencies, I may disclose personal information. Security Reasons: In cases where it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats to the security of my domain or communications, I may share relevant information. With Your Consent: In certain cases, I may request your consent to share your information for specific purposes, such as introducing you to a colleague or sharing a resource. Cookies and Tracking Technologies This website may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance user experience and collect information on site usage. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. Cookies are used for:\nAnalytics: To track visitor behavior and improve the website. Session Management: To authenticate users and manage API access or website sessions. Data Retention I will retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, such as for ongoing communication, security, or legal compliance. Data may be anonymized for analytical purposes or to improve website functionality.\nData Security I take the security of personal data seriously and implement reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss. However, please note that no method of communication or electronic storage is completely secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.\nYour Rights Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete the data collected about you. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact me via the methods provided on my website.\nChanges to This Privacy Policy I reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued interaction with me or my domain constitutes your acceptance of those changes.\nContact If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your data protection rights, feel free to contact me through the contact form available on the website or via email.\n","wordCount":"1064","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-09-24T13:22:48-04:00","dateModified":"2024-09-24T13:22:48-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/privacy-policy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Cameron Michelis","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent"></h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-09-24 13:22:48 -0400 EDT'>September 24, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1064 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=post-content><h3 id=privacy-policy>Privacy Policy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#privacy-policy>#</a></h3><h4 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h4><p>This Privacy Policy outlines how I, Cameron Michelis, collect, use, and protect personal information from anyone interacting with me or my domain, through any protocol or communication method.
